Nolan’s willingness to die puts Rex off his footing, and he can’t help indulging his curiosity with a harmless detail. How much deader could his benefactor get?
Nolan: Jade Claws? That’s quite a name. Not the first time I’ve heard it, either. They think we aren’t listening, but I hear things. Very interesting things…
Rex: Such as?
Nolan: Oh, I'm not one to gossip. Not without more proof. Now let’s get on with this. 
Nolan: I’ve had a hankering for liver recently. Maybe you’ll feed me mine before the lights go out? Not many have savored THAT delicacy, I’ll wager!
Rex considers pressing him for information as he lumbers over him. His senses were powerful, but he had no innate instinct to detect lies. 
Taking the indirect route to his spine, feeling the bone crack and crunch in his vice grip, hearing the final breath leave his lips… Nolan has taken some of the fun out of it.
